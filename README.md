### Greetings Visitor ðŸ‘½

I'm a web developer. I code in Rust, JavaScript/Typescript, and React, to name a few.

- I'm always working on something fun and interesting
- I'm a second-career developer. If I can learn to code, so can you (assuming you don't know how)
- One of these days I want to make something with Rust and WebAssembly

### Are you new to web development?

If you are just starting out, check out [Seven Simple Projects](https://github.com/ulises-codes/seven-simple-projects). Each folder is a small project comprised of nothing but HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, designed to help you understand the basics before moving on to more complicated subjects.
