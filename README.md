#### Are you new to web development?

If you are just starting out, check out [Seven Simple Projects](https://github.com/ulises-codes/seven-simple-projects). Each folder is a small project comprised of nothing but HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, designed to help you understand the basics before moving on to more complicated subjects.
